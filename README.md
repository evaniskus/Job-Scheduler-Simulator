# Job-Scheduler-Simulator

This is a program designed to simulate different job scheduling algorithms of operating systems. 
Specifically, this program implements the following algorithms:

* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
* Round Robin (RR) with input time slice

When running this program, it will generate a number of datasets of specified lengths, and then find the mean of all average turnaround 
times for each algorithm.

The dataset of jobs named jobs.txt in the same directory is generated by the program. 
The dataset represents a list of jobs along with the time needed to process each job. An example of a dataset can be found in jobs.txt 
and the file is formatted as so:

```
Job1
(Job1's weight)
Job2
(Job2's weight)
.
.
.
Jobn
(Jobn's weight)
```
